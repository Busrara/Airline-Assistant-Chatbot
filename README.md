This Python-based chatbot assists users with basic airline services, including flight searches, making reservations, and canceling bookings. The script simulates a conversation where users can:

1- Search Flights: Enter departure and destination cities, along with travel dates, to search for available flights.
2- Make a Reservation: Users can book a flight by providing flight details and their name.
3- Cancel a Booking: A user can cancel a previously made booking by entering a booking ID.

The chatbot gives feedback to the user after each action, ensuring smooth interaction and simulating an actual airline assistant system. Time delays are used to mimic real-time processing, making the interaction feel more realistic.

This project can be expanded with additional features, such as managing multiple reservations or integrating with a real flight database or API.
